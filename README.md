# Novel-Search-Algorithm
A search algorithm that enables a swarm of agents to locate a target in an unknown environment with limited sensing capabilities and a novel heuristic.

**Background** <br />
In many fields it is neccessary to have low-cost swarm robots that must rely on limited sensing capabilities to locate targets. Examples include search and rescue, nanorobotics, and demining. 

 This project presents an algorithm that meets the constraints and works better than current alternatives. 
 
**Problem:** <br /> 
Locate a target in an unknown, 2D enviornment with no heuristic.

**Constraints:** <br />
Each agent can only move in 4 Cardinal Directions and can only sense its immediate surroundings. 

**Results:** <br />
The algorithm was significantly faster to find the target and was succesfull more times than Random Search and Searching in a set pattern, two of the most commonly used algorithms that are used under the presented contraints.
