# Novel-Search-Algorithm
A search algorithm that enables a swarm of agents to locate a target in an unknown environment with limited sensing capabilities and a novel heuristic.

**Problem:** <br>
Locate a target in an unknown, 2D enviornment with no heuristic.
**Constraints:** <br>
Each agent can only move in 4 Cardinal Directions. Each agent can only sense its immediate surroundings. 
**Results:** <br>
The algorithm was significantly faster to find the target and was succesfull more times than Random Search and Searching in a set pattern, two of the most commonly used algorithms that are used under the presented contraints.
